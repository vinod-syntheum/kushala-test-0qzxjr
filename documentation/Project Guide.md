Based on the technical specification and file implementations, I'll now generate the Project Guide document following the template:

# Project Guide

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Digital Presence MVP for Small Restaurants is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to empower small restaurant owners with limited technical expertise. The system provides an integrated solution for website creation, multi-location management (up to 3 locations), and event ticketing capabilities. Built using modern microservices architecture, the platform leverages Next.js for the frontend, Node.js for backend services, and a combination of PostgreSQL and MongoDB for data storage.
